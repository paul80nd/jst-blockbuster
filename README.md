# BlockBuster

Extremely basic emulation of the game board used in the Blockbuster TV show as a means to share departmental strategy at a
company offsite. Probably meaningless outside the company I work for but shared here publicly in case of interest.

Made up of a single html file incorporating css styles, an SVG image and basic javascript to add interactivity.

## Usage

* Open index.html
* Click anywhere to close title/splash screen
* Goal is to get left to right
  * Click any letter to select it
  * Host asks question (what 'P' hosts our applications in a consistent and cost effective way)
  * Crowd guesses. Once right answer given (e.g.  'Platform') click letter to mark it blue.
  * All hexagons with same letter are marked white (no longer selectable)
  * If hexagon clicked in error one more click reverts board state
